## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements and compares three classic CSP-based AI algorithms to solve Sudoku puzzles:

1. **Basic Backtracking** (Brute-force)
2. **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)** Heuristic
3. **Forward Checking** (Constraint Propagation)

ðŸ”¹ **Key Features:**
- Solve puzzles using different algorithms  
- Variable grid sizes: `4Ã—4`, `9Ã—9`, `16Ã—16`, and beyond  
- Adjustable difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, Hard  
- Hint generation & solution checker  
- Performance comparison via time, recursion depth, and nodes visited  
- GUI interface with real-time validation and player-AI interaction

## ðŸ§© Game Rules & Innovations

### âœ… Classic Rules:
- Every row, column, and subgrid must contain all digits exactly once.
- Puzzles start with given clues and must be completed logically.

### ðŸš€ Innovations:
- Custom grid sizes (4Ã—4 to 25Ã—25)  
- Real-time error highlighting  
- Hint-based gameplay with AI assistance  
- Difficulty control through clue density  
- Performance metrics visualization (Matplotlib)

## ðŸ§  AI Techniques Used

- **Backtracking** â€“ Standard DFS, checks validity, backtracks on failure.
- **MRV Heuristic** â€“ Prioritizes cells with the fewest legal values.
- **Forward Checking** â€“ Dynamically prunes illegal options during search.

## ðŸ“Š Performance Evaluation

| Metric             | Backtracking | MRV Heuristic | Forward Checking |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------|------------------|
| Time (9Ã—9 Easy)    | ~0.5 sec     | ~0.05 sec     | ~0.03 sec        |
| Nodes Visited      | 10,000+      | ~500          | ~300             |
| Recursion Depth    | High         | Low           | Low              |

*Performance tested on puzzles with varying difficulties and sizes (4Ã—4 to 16Ã—16).*
